# üíº Pension Wallet Smart Contract 

## What

The **PensionWallet.sol** smart contract is a long-term vesting wallet designed to manage retirement savings on-chain. It locks deposited funds for a specified number of years, allowing the beneficiary to withdraw vested portions over time.
 
However, if the beneficiary faces verified emergencies (e.g., job loss, medical condition), the contract allows early unlocking via DAO-style **emergency approval** (e.g., multisig or community governance).
 
## Why 

Traditional retirement systems are rigid and lack transparency. This smart contract offers:
 
- ‚úÖ Transparent, tamper-proof long-term vesting
- ‚è≥ Time-based release of funds (no early access unless approved)
- üõ°Ô∏è Emergency flexibility via community/DAO
- ‚öôÔ∏è Admin control to pause/resume in exceptional situations

## Features

- Time-based vesting using `block.timestamp`
- Admin-deposited funds, with dynamic top-ups 
- Withdrawals only allowed when funds are vested or emergency unlock is triggered
- Events emitted for all major state changes

## Use Cases

- Personal retirement wallets
- Web3-native pension programs
- Freelancers/DAO contributors with long-term savings
- DAO-governed corporate retirement schemes
